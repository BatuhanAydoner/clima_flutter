* A city name can be used to get the weather.
* Depending on the weather, Clima app can suggest clothes.

## My Goal

## What I Learnt
* How to use Dart to perform asynchronous tasks.
* Understand async and await.
* Learn about Futures and how to work with them.
* How to network with the Dart http package.
* How to parse JSON objects using the Dart convert package.
* How to pass data forwards and backwards between screens using the Navigator.
* How to use the Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
* How to use the TextField Widget to take user input.

## Libraries Used
